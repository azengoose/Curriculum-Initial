        The main issue is that we don't want creating curriculums to feel like
        filling in a form. What it should be, is a fulfilling and long-term
        exercise anyone can begin doing as a means to share their journeys and
        paths, not just the results of the journey. We're working on it â€“ crude
        estimated time of completion by December 2022.

      <p>
        The number one priority at the moment is ensuring the sharing of
        external curriculums is as good as it can be.
