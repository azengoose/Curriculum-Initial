## The Elements of a Curriculum

Before you click away, the following proposed elements have been
grouped in one way to serve as an encompassing guideline for what a
fully-fleshed out curriculum would look like.

It isn't required or even usual for all elements to be incorporated
into a curriculum for it to be a good or popular curriculum.

If you are not involved in some standard body or institution in the
individual creation of a curriculum, I encourage you to be bold and be
selective about what to emphasise in your curriculum.
