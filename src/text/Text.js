      <p>
        The main issue is that we don't want creating curriculums to feel like
        filling in a form. What it should be, is a fulfilling and long-term
        exercise anyone can begin doing as a means to share their journeys and
        paths, not just the results of the journey. We're working on it â€“ crude
        estimated time of completion by December 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number one priority at the moment is ensuring the sharing of
        external curriculums is as good as it can be.

      <p>
        Submit externally completed curriculums. For example, these can be
        websites, blogs, uploaded videos, images, diagrams. Curriculums can only
        be submitted for pending. It is judged by the public in an intermediary
        period and by a rotating committee, before being established into the
        database proper.
