# Curriculum-Internals 

Just a separate space for developing the internal curriculum component. This rests on top of the basic MVP of providing a filterable directory of external curriculums on the web. 

The MVP itself is useful, but it is a far cry from something that is extremely useful. I do think that it can be a useful resource, but I also think that beginning to develop this later stage internal component will give more insight into how the external curriculums can be better approached, regardless of whether the effort is successful or not.
