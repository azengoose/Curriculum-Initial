        <p>
          The following is a set of principles and proposed guidelines for
          crafting a 'good' curriculum. Ideally, one systematically reviews and
          tests all factors; realistically, one skims through and considers an
          assortment of these points.

      <h3 className="theme-h3 p-h3">Curriculum Problems</h3>
      <p className="centered-p">
        <p>
          Knowing some actionable steps and principles for crafting good
          curriculums, it is also useful to take a look at the problems
          underlying the justifications for such principles.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Knowledge.</b> People make choices as to what they learn, thus
            making some knowledge appear more visible, influencing the perceived
            importance and priority of certain disciplines or fields of study.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Learner.</b> How much accountability should the learner have in
            terms of goals, outcomes and optionality? The invovlement of the
            learner in the meta process of learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Technical/Professional.</b> Who should be the ones to be creating
            curriculums? And problems of technical creation and design.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Stakeholders.</b> Conflict of values and interests during
            decision-making with the stakeholders involved in making the
            curriculum.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Definition.</b> All kinds of instructional materials are labeled
            as "curriculum", which is confusing and ambiguous as hell.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Measurement.</b> As the origins, assessments and outcomes of
            curriculums are so varied, it is difficult to measure and therefore
            compare curriculums.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Effectiveness.</b> As no consensus of taxonomy exists of
            curricular features, effective curricula is still much of a guessing
            game.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Implementation.</b> There is often a difference between the
            intended guidelines for a curriculum, and how a curriculum is
            actually carried out and implemented.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 className="theme-h3">Democratising Curriculums</h3>
        <p>
          People share their 'stories' of learning or experience all the time,
          whether in the form of speeches, biographies, or advice. The primary
          difference here in democratising the making of curriculums is
          departing from an institutionally based task and explicitly putting
          learning goals in the hands of the wider public.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who should be responsible for making curriculums and who should make
          them in the first place and for what purpose? Leading people down a
          path of regret, misery and suffering is completely a possibility, as
          is leading people up a path of empowerment, joy and life satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such an endeavour perhaps will skew more towards a kind of liberal
          education, more progressive than conservative, characterised by both a
          more fragmented and connected society.
