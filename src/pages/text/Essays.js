        <p>
          The internet of the first quarter of the 21st century is a rampant
          mess of content and resources. Iterxue is one such attempt to help
          reconcile and curate this hole in the web towards a more integrative
          model of technologically assisted education and lifelong learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is little to no consensus or well-formed method of vessel for
          integrating the premise of traditional education as it has existed for
          the past 100 hundred years ago since the conception of the modern
          'school' originated from the economic model of factory work, which is
          becoming increasingly redundant, and especially as the core modus
          operandi of education.

        <h3 className="theme-h3">On How this Exists: A Personal Story</h3>
        <p>
          The year is 2020. As a bleak pandemic swept through the world, my
          peers and I silently completed our final years of formal education.
          While students and teachers bravely adapted to navigate this new
          world, I was grappling with the issue I found most compelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I wanted to learn everything I could about the world we live
          in. The internet exists. Check. Secondly, to put this into action, I
          needed to create curriculums and continually evolving plans as to how
          to continue my learning development. I began arduously researching for
          online and offline resources, advice and curriculums and furiously
          learning with a focus on breadth, rather than specialisation. It was
          my second year in this journey after leaving university because of my
          utmost belief in this self-learning ethos, that I began this project.
          It is the growing result of the pains I did and will continue
          encountering in my own journey in the designing of learning pathways,
          and I wish to share that, and make it something even more for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot envision not needing this resource in the future, unless it
          is superceded by something better. Either way, I would still be
          satisfied having contributed my dues.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are in support of this endeavour, find a use for this project
          in your life. I encourage you to. Life is long, and lifelong learning
          is the end of a short life rich with understanding, compassion and
          experience.

        <p>
          If you've used Wikipedia, or ever glanced between the seemingly
          endless bookshelves of your local library as a kid, or scanned over
          the spines of an encyclopedia set, or browsed through the categories
          of Youtube, or Twitch, or Twitter, or really, any content website,
          you've already attempted to tackle the problem of trying to make sense
          of all of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          More specifically, I'm talking about the knowledge of all the world.
          The point is that all these platforms, companies and overly ambitious
          individuals have tried to categorise literally everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm of the thought that it is important to gain insights by
          considering all of these 'models' or categorisations that other people
          have painstakingly made, and not to collapse them all. Instead,
          unparadoxically, to leave all these models out in the open. Then, each
          of us can decide which ones are better than others, which aren't so
          good, and which ones to think about sticking together.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a central problem of a web that possesses the information on
          Literally Everything, that impacts recommendation algorithms, the
          philosophy of human exploration versus giving people what they 'want'
          and the entire premise of the search engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          TLDR; overall models are very important. We're going to do our best to
          do this idea justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the immediately practical implementations of this, is that I've
          noticed that there is a clear bias of online resources catered towards
          the subjects of Computing, Languages and Business. Therefore, the bias
          of our resources will be made transparent and accessible, and an
          attempt at subject equality will be made.
