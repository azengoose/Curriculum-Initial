      <h3 className="p-h3">Personal Problems</h3>
      <p className="centered-p"><p><span>The year is 2020. As the sounds of life retreated into homes and silence began occupying streets, my peers and I quietly completed our final years of formal education. While students, teachers, parents bravely adapted to navigate a new world, I was beginning to struggle with the issue I now find most compelling.</span></p>
<p><span>I want to learn everything.</span></p>
<p><span>Yeah, you can say it&rsquo;s selfish. But that&rsquo;s not the end point. It&rsquo;s been said before. It has been said to be too ambitious, too wide, too general, a meaningless goal that will leave you aimless and without a job.</span></p>
<p><span>I had internet access. So I began researching for online and offline resources, advice and curriculums and furiously learning with a focus on breadth, rather than specialisation. I made plenty of my own curriculums, adapted them as I went, completed them. Needless to say, they were mine. They spurred me to do what no university or college will ask of you.</span></p>
<p><span>Life is long, and lifelong learning is the end of a short life rich with empathy, excellence and experience.</span></p>
<p><span>At multiple points during these trials, I realised that I was often heading into territory without a map. You can do it. It&rsquo;s possible. But the prevalence of plans, curriculums, stories and guides to lean on in times of uncertainty, made life more bearable and more enjoyable for me. Imagine mentors, imagine teachers, imagine any role model you look up to, with a lifestyle that you want to emulate, sharing and laying out their plans. You look over their shoulder. This is gold.</span></p>
<p><span>At some point I realised that for me, this was never going to stop. In the back of my mind, I had already conceptualised lifelong learning, but only after attacking the problem of breadth head-on, did it crystallise in my heart. This will not end.</span></p>
<p><span>From one of a kaleidoscopic many of curious, learning nuts, to another, here are a selection of quality curriculums from the internet.</span></p>

<h3 className="theme-h3">What Makes Good Curriculums</h3>
<p className="p-h3"><p><span>The main unique points I wish to bring to attention when it comes to curriculums presented in an accessibly online format:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>Scope</strong>: Not containing small or detailed steps. Completing the curriculum should have a timeframe of mostly weeks, months, or several years. Minimum of 3 steps, recommended 5-9 and maximum 16 (rough guidelines).</span></li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: Ideally, the curriculum has been trialled before. With a selection process of some resources over many others or rationales, justifications. Not just, this was something I tried and it is therefore the best resource.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity</strong>: Include a minimum of 2-3 platforms or 3+ authors in the resources.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Problems and principles in more detail:</span></p>

<h3 className="p-h3">Collective Challenges</h3>
<p className="centered-p"><p><span>The internet of the first quarter of the 21st century is a rampant mess of content and resources. Iterxue is one such attempt to help reconcile and curate this hole in the web towards a more integrative model of technologically assisted education and lifelong learning.</span></p>
<p><span>There is little to no consensus or well-formed method of vessel for integrating the premise of traditional education as it has existed for the past 100 hundred years ago since the conception of the modern 'school' originated from the economic model of factory work, which is becoming increasingly redundant, and especially as the core modus operandi of education.<br /></span></p>

//         <p>
//           Before you click away, the following proposed elements have been
//           grouped in one way to serve as an encompassing guideline for what a
//           fully-fleshed out curriculum would look like.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           It isn't required or even usual for all elements to be incorporated
//           into a curriculum for it to be a good or popular curriculum.

//         <p>
//           If you are not involved in some standard body or institution in the
//           individual creation of a curriculum, I encourage you to be bold and be
//           selective about what to emphasise in your curriculum.
