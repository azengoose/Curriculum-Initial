          This site is a crossroads sign. Paths lay before you; maps crafted
          painstakingly by others so that you have a clearer route to travel,
          led by your own compass.

          <b>Iterations</b>: To adapt and be a positive force in our own
          environment, we have to change and recreate ourselves many times over
          our lifetimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Itineraries</b>: Having a route or outline of a journey to learn is
          quite useful. Paths that can be accomplished in many ways, for all
          kinds of people and goals.

          Iters.to is in early stages; a result of experimentation made mostly
