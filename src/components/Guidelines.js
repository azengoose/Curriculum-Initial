        <h2 className="theme-h2">The Elements of a Curriculum</h2>
        <p>
          Before you click away, the following proposed elements have been
          grouped in one way to serve as an encompassing guideline for what a
          fully-fleshed out curriculum would look like.
        </p>
        <p>
          It isn't required or even usual for all elements to be incorporated
          into a curriculum for it to be a good or popular curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not involved in some standard body or institution in the
          individual creation of a curriculum, I encourage you to be bold and be
          selective about what to emphasise in your curriculum.
