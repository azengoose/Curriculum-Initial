// MVP SITE SUMMARY: 
// Unsigned, a user can browse public curriculums and resources.

// MVP AIMS:
// To provide curated curriculums and sets of resources for online
//  and in person learning pathways, and act as the main source of truth
//  as a crossroads sign for people to explore great resources.
// From this, people can have more clear goals and directions of
//  HOW to get somewhere but still not the WHY. This site provides
//  clarity in life, but also planning is useful, not plans.
// WHY: There are a lot of resources on the web, and not enough
//  curation of those into organised places.
